ABSTRACT. A dominating set in a graph is a subset of the vertices in the graph such that every vertex of the graph is either in the dominating set or is adjacent to a vertex in the dominating set. The minimum size of a dominating set for a particular graph is its domination number. We discuss some well-known results and provide some applications.
